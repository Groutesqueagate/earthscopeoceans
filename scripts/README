JavaScript Scripts that give the map its functionality

-- map.js is the main script - It uses all of the other scripts to put markers onto the map
and give each of them an info box with the pertinent information

-- DataPoint.js - Calculates important info about each float and stores it in a DataPoint

-- EEZ.js - Uses a given latitude and longitude to find the EEZ of a point

-- GEBCO.js - Sends a rest request to the GEBCO api to get information about the depth
of the location that a float is in

-- fileReader.js - fetches float information from FJS's SOM

-- infobubble.js - A git library by Luke Mahe which builds info bubbles
